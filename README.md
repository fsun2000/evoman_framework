The results for the final CNA and NEAT can be reproduced by running CNA_uniform_crossover.py and neat_experiment.py. 
For NEAT, the resulting fitness statistics per generation and mean individual gains per run can be found in the specialist_neat directory.
For CNA, the fitness statistics can be found in CNA_final_scores directory, while the gains can be calculated by running CNA_get_gains.py. These gains are then also saved in CNA_final_scores.
